# Illium Engine

A small-ish game engine I am making to learn about engine architecture.
The current plans are:
- [x] Basic rendering of cubes
- [x] Basic Camera System
- [ ] Primitive lighting system
- [ ] Model loading
- [ ] PBR
- [ ] Ray tracing (heavy doubt)

I'll add more when I think of it and finish stuff.
